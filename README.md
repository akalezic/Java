This repository consists of projects done during my courses at Loyola University Chicago, as well as personal projects that I have done outside of my courses. The programming language used is Java.

The primary program is TeaRecommenderGUI, which is an applet I designed using JavaFX that takes the user through a series of questions in order to determine what tea best fits their preferences. I initially designed this program in Python first but prefer this version. I will subsequently be updating the Python version in order to make the interface similar to this program.

ReadDailyConsole is a program in which the user interacts with the console to specify how many books they need to read, what amount of time they have to read them in, then enters the titles and number of pages in each book. The program then calculates how many pages the user would need to read per day in order to finish the books in the given amount of time. I intend to expand on this program to use a GUI.
