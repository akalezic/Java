This repository consists of projects done during my courses at Loyola University Chicago, as well as personal projects that I have done outside of my courses. The programming language used is Java.

The primary program is TeaRecommenderGUI, which is an applet I designed using JavaFX that takes the user through a series of questions in order to determine what tea best fits their preferences. I initially designed this program in Python first but enjoy the interface of the Java version a bit more.
